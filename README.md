# Simulation and Estimation of MIMO & massive MIMO Channel, Channel Capacity and Spatial Modulation 
## Introduction
Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) is one of the most common forms of wireless, and it plays an important role in the deployment of LTE and the wireless broadband technology standard Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (WiMAX). LTE uses MIMO and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to increase the data rate up to 100 Mbps and beyond.
